## Organization Tips

### 1. Keep Everything Organized
- Use clear folder names
- Use consistent file naming conventions
- Keep related files together
- Date files when appropriate (YYYY-MM-DD format)

### 2. Version Control
- Use Git to track changes
- Make regular commits with meaningful messages
- Don't commit sensitive data (passwords, API keys)
- Use `.gitignore` for build artifacts and dependencies

### 3. Backup Regularly
- Keep backups in multiple locations
- Use cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.)
- Test your backups periodically
- Don't rely on a single copy

### 4. Evidence Collection
- Take screenshots as you work
- Save all stakeholder communications
- Keep notes from meetings
- Document problems and solutions as they happen

## File Naming Conventions

Good examples:
- `2025-09-15_stakeholder_interview_notes.pdf`
- `homepage_wireframe_v2.png`
- `login_function_unit_tests.py`
- `search_algorithm_pseudocode.md`

Bad examples:
- `Document1.pdf`
- `Screenshot.png`
- `final_FINAL_v3_actualfinal.docx`
- `stuff.txt`

## Getting Started

1. **Create your folder structure** - Set up the basic folders you'll need
2. **Start documenting** - Begin with Analysis phase
3. **Collect evidence continuously** - Don't wait until the end
4. **Stay organized** - Spend a few minutes each session organizing files
5. **Review the guides** - Refer to 01-06 markdown files for detailed guidance

## Important Reminders

- ⚠️ **Don't put template files here** - This is for YOUR work only
- 🔒 **Keep backups** - Hardware fails, files corrupt, accidents happen
- 📅 **Date everything** - You'll thank yourself later
- 📝 **Document as you go** - Don't leave it all to the end
- 🎯 **Stay organized** - Good organization saves time and reduces stress

## Privacy and Security

- **Never commit passwords or API keys** to version control
- **Be careful with personal data** - Follow GDPR guidelines
- **Anonymize stakeholder data** if necessary
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration

## Need Help?

If you're unsure about what to include or how to organize something:

1. Check the relevant guide (01_Analysis.md, 02_Design.md, etc.)
2. Look at the assessment criteria
3. Ask your teacher
4. Focus on what will demonstrate your skills best
