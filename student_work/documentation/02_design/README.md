# Design Phase

This folder contains all documentation for the **Design Phase** of your OCR NEA project.

## What to Include

### 1. System Architecture
- Overall system structure diagram
- Major components/modules identification
- Component interaction diagrams
- Justification for architectural decisions

### 2. Algorithm Design
- Pseudocode for key algorithms
- Flowcharts for complex logic
- Efficiency considerations
- Data processing logic

### 3. Data Structures
- Choice and justification of data structures
- Database schema (if applicable)
- Entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs)
- Data validation and storage plans

### 4. User Interface Design
- Wireframes/mockups for all screens
- User workflow diagrams
- Navigation structure
- Usability considerations

### 5. Technical Decisions
- Programming language selection and justification
- Development tools and libraries
- Testing approach
- Security considerations

### 6. Design Documentation
- Class diagrams (for OOP)
- Module structure
- API design (if applicable)
- Configuration plans

## File Naming Suggestions

- `system_architecture.md` or `system_architecture.pdf`
- `algorithm_pseudocode.md`
- `database_schema.md` or `erd_diagram.png`
- `wireframe_homepage.png`
- `wireframe_login.png`
- `class_diagram.png`
- `technical_decisions.md`
- `data_structures.md`

## Tips

- **Design before coding**: Don't skip this phase
- **Use diagrams**: Visual representations help understanding
- **Be detailed**: Detailed designs make coding easier
- **Get feedback**: Show designs to your stakeholder
- **Justify decisions**: Explain WHY you made each choice
- **Keep it realistic**: Design what you can actually implement

## Assessment Focus

Examiners look for:
- Clear, detailed designs that could be followed by another programmer
- Appropriate use of diagrams and pseudocode
- Well-justified technical decisions
- Evidence of planning before implementation
- Connection between requirements and design

## Common Design Artifacts

- System architecture diagrams
- Class diagrams
- ER diagrams
- Flowcharts
- Pseudocode
- Wireframes/mockups
- Data dictionaries
- Algorithm descriptions

## Related Resources

- See `/02_Design.md` in the root directory for detailed guidance
- Check the OCR specification for design expectations
- Use appropriate diagramming tools (draw.io, Lucidchart, etc.)

**Remember**: Good design saves time during development and produces better code!
