# Analysis Phase

This folder contains all documentation for the **Analysis Phase** of your OCR NEA project.

## What to Include

### 1. Problem Identification
- Document describing the problem you're solving
- Justification for why this problem needs a computational solution
- Confirmation that the problem is of appropriate complexity

### 2. Stakeholder Analysis
- Identification of your client/stakeholder
- Interview notes and transcripts
- Stakeholder requirements documentation
- Evidence of communication (emails, meeting notes)

### 3. Research & Investigation
- Analysis of existing solutions
- Research into the problem domain
- Technical research relevant to your solution
- Comparison of similar systems

### 4. Requirements Specification
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system must do
- **Non-functional Requirements**: Performance, usability, security, etc.
- Prioritization of requirements (essential vs. desirable)
- Justification for each requirement

### 5. Success Criteria
- Measurable criteria for project success
- SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Link each criterion to stakeholder needs
- Clear definition of what "success" means for your project

## File Naming Suggestions

- `problem_statement.md` or `problem_identification.md`
- `stakeholder_interview_YYYY-MM-DD.pdf`
- `requirements_specification.md`
- `success_criteria.md`
- `existing_solutions_research.md`
- `stakeholder_feedback.pdf`

## Tips

- **Be thorough**: The analysis phase is your foundation
- **Document everything**: Include all stakeholder communications
- **Be realistic**: Don't over-promise on requirements
- **Stay focused**: Keep requirements aligned with stakeholder needs
- **Use evidence**: Back up your decisions with research and stakeholder input

## Assessment Focus

Examiners look for:
- Clear problem identification
- Thorough stakeholder engagement
- Well-researched and justified requirements
- Measurable success criteria
- Professional documentation
