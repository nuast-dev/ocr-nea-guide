# Development Log

This folder contains your **Development Log** - a record of your implementation journey.

## What to Include

### 1. Development Sessions
- Log entry for each development session
- Date and duration of each session
- What you worked on
- What you accomplished
- Problems encountered and solutions

### 2. Version Control
- Regular Git commits with meaningful messages
- Branch management documentation
- Version history
- Major milestones

### 3. Code Documentation
- Inline code comments (in your actual code)
- Technical documentation
- API documentation (if applicable)
- Configuration guides

### 4. Development Evidence
- Screenshots of work in progress
- Code snippets showing evolution
- Before/after comparisons
- Feature demonstrations

### 5. Stakeholder Feedback During Development
- Show-and-tell sessions with stakeholder
- Feedback received
- How feedback was incorporated
- Evidence of iterative improvement

### 6. Problems and Solutions
- Technical challenges encountered
- Bugs and their fixes
- Design changes and why they were made
- Learning moments and research

## Log Entry Format Suggestion

```markdown
# Development Session - YYYY-MM-DD

**Duration:** X hours
**Focus:** Brief description

## What I Worked On
- Feature or task 1
- Feature or task 2

## What I Accomplished
- Achievement 1
- Achievement 2

## Problems Encountered
1. **Problem:** Description
   **Solution:** How you solved it

## Screenshots/Evidence
- Screenshot descriptions

## Next Steps
- What you plan to do next

## Stakeholder Feedback
- Any feedback received this session
```

## File Naming Suggestions

- `dev_log_YYYY-MM-DD.md` for each session
- `milestone_v1_0.md` for major versions
- `stakeholder_feedback_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `bug_fixes_log.md`
- `technical_decisions_log.md`

## Tips

- **Log as you go**: Don't wait until the end
- **Be honest**: Include failures and problems
- **Include evidence**: Screenshots, code snippets
- **Date everything**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Be specific**: "Fixed login bug" is better than "Fixed stuff"
- **Show iteration**: Demonstrate how your code evolved
- **Document decisions**: Why did you change your approach?

## Assessment Focus

Examiners look for:
- Regular development over time (not all at once)
- Evidence of iterative development
- Problem-solving skills
- Technical competence
- Professional documentation
- Stakeholder engagement during development

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Write the log after finishing development
- ❌ Only log successes (failures are learning opportunities)
- ❌ Copy-paste entire code files
- ❌ Make vague entries like "Did some coding"
- ❌ Forget to include dates

## Related Resources

- See `/03_DevLog.md` in the root directory for detailed guidance
- Use version control (Git) alongside your log
- Reference specific commits in your log entries

**Remember**: Your development log tells the story of HOW you built your solution. Make it detailed and honest!
