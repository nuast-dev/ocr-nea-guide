## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Last-Minute Rush
**Pitfall:** Trying to complete everything in the final week.  
**Solution:** Use the full 12 months. The submission phase should be for review and polish, not creating content.

### ❌ Missing Evidence
**Pitfall:** Realizing at the end that you don't have screenshots or documentation.  
**Solution:** Collect evidence throughout the project. Take screenshots as you work. Keep all notes and emails.

### ❌ Inconsistent Formatting
**Pitfall:** Different fonts, styles, and layouts across sections.  
**Solution:** Create a style template at the start and apply it consistently. Do a formatting review before submission.

### ❌ Broken Cross-References
**Pitfall:** References to "See Section 4.2" that don't exist or are incorrect.  
**Solution:** Do a final check of all cross-references. Use your word processor's cross-reference features.

### ❌ Code Doesn't Run
**Pitfall:** Submitting code that has errors or won't run.  
**Solution:** Test your code on a clean system before submission. Include setup instructions.

### ❌ Missing Files
**Pitfall:** Forgetting to include essential files (images, database, libraries).  
**Solution:** Create a submission checklist. Test by extracting your submission on another system.

### ❌ Page/Word Count Issues
**Pitfall:** Exceeding or being well under recommended lengths.  
**Solution:** Monitor page counts throughout. Quality over quantity, but meet general guidelines.

### ❌ Poor Quality Screenshots
**Pitfall:** Blurry, cropped, or illegible screenshots.  
**Solution:** Take high-resolution screenshots. Ensure text is readable. Crop appropriately but show context.

### ❌ No Proofreading
**Pitfall:** Submitting work with typos and grammatical errors.  
**Solution:** Proofread multiple times. Use spelling/grammar checkers. Have someone else review if possible.
