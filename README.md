# OCR A-Level Computer Science (H446) NEA Guide

A comprehensive guide and scaffold for completing the OCR A Level Computer Science Non-Exam Assessment (NEA).

## Overview

The NEA is worth 20% of your A Level grade and requires you to:
- Identify and analyze a problem
- Design a computational solution
- Develop and test your solution
- Evaluate the success of your project

This guide provides structure, checklists, and timelines to help you successfully complete your NEA over a 12-month period.

## 12-Month Timeline

| Month | Phase | Focus Areas |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Month 1-2** | [Analysis](01_Analysis.md) | Problem identification, stakeholder interviews, research |
| **Month 3-4** | [Design](02_Design.md) | System architecture, algorithms, UI design, data structures |
| **Month 5-9** | [Development](03_DevLog.md) | Iterative development with logging all changes |
| **Month 8-10** | [Testing](04_Testing.md) | Unit tests, integration tests, user testing |
| **Month 10-11** | [Evaluation](05_Evaluation.md) | Success criteria review, improvements, maintenance |
| **Month 11-12** | [Submission](06_Submission.md) | Final documentation review, compilation, submission |

**Note:** Some phases overlap intentionally. Testing should begin early, and development continues during testing phase.

## Project Sections

Follow these sections in order to complete your NEA:

1. **[Analysis](01_Analysis.md)** - Understanding the problem and requirements
2. **[Design](02_Design.md)** - Planning your solution architecture
3. **[Development Log](03_DevLog.md)** - Building and documenting your solution
4. **[Testing](04_Testing.md)** - Validating your solution works correctly
5. **[Evaluation](05_Evaluation.md)** - Reflecting on success and improvements
6. **[Submission](06_Submission.md)** - Preparing final documentation

## Getting Started

1. Read through each section to understand the full NEA process
2. Start with [01_Analysis.md](01_Analysis.md) 
3. Use the checklists to track your progress
4. Keep all your work organized in the `student_work/` folder
5. Refer back to this timeline regularly to stay on track

## Important Reminders

- **Start early** - Don't underestimate the time required
- **Document everything** - Your development log is crucial
- **Test regularly** - Don't leave testing until the end
- **Ask for help** - Consult your teacher when stuck
- **Backup your work** - Use version control (Git) religiously
