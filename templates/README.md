# Templates

This folder contains template files to help you get started with your NEA documentation.

## Available Templates

### Document Templates
- Use these as starting points for your own work
- Customize them to fit your specific project
- Don't just fill in blanks - make them your own

## How to Use Templates

1. Copy the template file you need
2. Rename it appropriately for your project
3. Fill in your specific content
4. Remove any sections that don't apply
5. Add additional sections as needed

## Important Notes

- **Don't copy examples verbatim** - adapt them to your project
- **Templates are guides** - not rigid requirements
- **Quality over templates** - original work is better than filled templates
- **Understand before using** - make sure you understand what each section requires

## Creating Your Own Structure

While templates can be helpful, you may find it better to:
- Start from scratch based on the guidance in the main markdown files
- Create your own structure that fits your project
- Use templates only as inspiration

Remember: Examiners value original, thoughtful work over template-based submissions.
