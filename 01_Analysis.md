## What to Do

The Analysis phase is where you identify and thoroughly understand the problem you're going to solve. This is the foundation of your entire project.

### Key Activities

1. **Identify a Problem**
   - Choose a real-world problem that needs a computational solution
   - Ensure the problem is neither too simple nor too complex
   - Confirm the problem requires programming (not just configuration)

2. **Research the Problem**
   - Investigate existing solutions
   - Understand the domain thoroughly
   - Identify gaps in current solutions

3. **Stakeholder Analysis**
   - Identify who will use your solution
   - Interview stakeholders to understand their needs
   - Document their requirements clearly

4. **Define Requirements**
   - Create functional requirements (what the system must do)
   - Create non-functional requirements (performance, usability, etc.)
   - Prioritize requirements (essential vs. desirable)

5. **Success Criteria**
   - Define measurable criteria for project success
   - Make criteria SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
   - Link each criterion to stakeholder needs

## Checklist

### Problem Identification
- [ ] Chosen a suitable problem of appropriate complexity
- [ ] Confirmed the problem requires a computational solution
- [ ] Verified the problem is solvable within the timeframe
- [ ] Identified the client/stakeholder

### Research & Investigation
- [ ] Researched existing solutions to similar problems
- [ ] Analyzed limitations of existing solutions
- [ ] Documented why a new solution is needed
- [ ] Investigated relevant technologies and tools

### Stakeholder Engagement
- [ ] Conducted stakeholder interviews (minimum 2-3 sessions)
- [ ] Documented stakeholder requirements
- [ ] Identified user personas
- [ ] Confirmed understanding with stakeholders

### Requirements Documentation
- [ ] Listed all functional requirements (10-15 minimum)
- [ ] Listed all non-functional requirements (5-10 minimum)
- [ ] Prioritized requirements (MoSCoW method)
- [ ] Obtained stakeholder sign-off on requirements

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Defined 8-12 measurable success criteria
- [ ] Linked each criterion to specific requirements
- [ ] Ensured criteria are testable
- [ ] Stakeholder has agreed to success criteria

### Documentation Quality
- [ ] All sections written clearly and professionally
- [ ] Evidence included (interview notes, screenshots, etc.)
- [ ] Proper referencing of research sources
- [ ] Proofread for spelling and grammar

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Problem Too Simple
**Pitfall:** Choosing a problem that can be solved with basic programming or existing tools.  
**Solution:** Ensure your project requires algorithms, data structures, and complex logic. Aim for A-Level standard complexity.

### ❌ Problem Too Complex
**Pitfall:** Selecting a problem that's beyond the scope of a student NEA project.  
**Solution:** Scale down your ambitions. Focus on a specific, well-defined aspect of a larger problem.

### ❌ Vague Requirements
**Pitfall:** Writing requirements like "The system should be fast" or "It should be user-friendly."  
**Solution:** Be specific and measurable: "The system should load search results in under 2 seconds" or "Users should be able to complete the checkout process in 3 clicks or less."

### ❌ No Real Stakeholder
**Pitfall:** Inventing a fake client or problem.  
**Solution:** Find a real person or organization with a genuine need. Schools, clubs, small businesses, or family members can be excellent stakeholders.

### ❌ Insufficient Research
**Pitfall:** Minimal investigation of existing solutions.  
**Solution:** Demonstrate thorough research of at least 3-5 existing solutions, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses.

### ❌ Non-Testable Success Criteria
**Pitfall:** Success criteria that can't be objectively measured.  
**Solution:** Each criterion must be measurable and testable. Avoid subjective terms like "good" or "nice."

### ❌ Copying Requirements
**Pitfall:** Copying generic requirements lists from the internet.  
**Solution:** All requirements must be specific to YOUR problem and YOUR stakeholder's needs.

### ❌ Poor Documentation
**Pitfall:** Writing informally or leaving sections incomplete.  
**Solution:** Write in a professional, technical style. Include diagrams, evidence, and proper citations.

## Section Structure

Your Analysis section should include:

1. **Introduction** (0.5-1 page)
   - Brief overview of the problem
   - Why this problem matters

2. **Problem Identification** (1-2 pages)
   - Detailed problem description
   - Context and background
   - Stakeholder identification

3. **Research** (2-3 pages)
   - Analysis of existing solutions (3-5 examples)
   - Comparison table of features
   - Justification for new solution

4. **Stakeholder Analysis** (2-3 pages)
   - Interview transcripts or detailed notes
   - User personas
   - Stakeholder requirements

5. **Requirements Specification** (2-4 pages)
   - Functional requirements list
   - Non-functional requirements list
   - Requirements prioritization

6. **Success Criteria** (1-2 pages)
   - List of 8-12 measurable criteria
   - How each will be tested
   - Link to requirements

**Total Expected Length:** 10-15 pages

## Tips for Success

- **Start Early:** Don't rush the analysis phase. A solid foundation makes everything else easier.
- **Real Stakeholders:** Work with a real person who genuinely needs your solution.
- **Evidence:** Include screenshots, interview transcripts, and research sources.
- **Be Specific:** Avoid vague language. Use numbers and measurable terms.
- **Regular Check-ins:** Meet with your stakeholder multiple times throughout the project.

## Assessment Focus

Examiners look for:
- Clear problem identification and justification
- Evidence of thorough research
- Well-documented stakeholder engagement
- Comprehensive, specific requirements
- Measurable success criteria linked to requirements
- Professional technical writing
